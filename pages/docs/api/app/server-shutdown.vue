                    closing all open listeners and then waits indefinitely for
                    all connections to return to idle before shutting down.

                This shows how to implement a graceful shutdown with Fiber and
                the <Tag>os/signal</Tag> package.
            </P>
            <P>
                This example relies on the use of channels, a data type in Go
                that allows you to send and receive data to/from specific places
                in an application.
            </P>
            <P>
                A channel is created, and registered with
                <B>signal.Notify</B> so that when the program receives an
                interrupt (for example, when CTRL+C is pressed), a notification
                is sent to the channel. Once this is received,
                <Tag>app.Shutdown</Tag> is called to close all active
                connections and return from <Tag>app.Listen</Tag>. After this
                point, cleanup functions can be run and the program eventually
                quits.
