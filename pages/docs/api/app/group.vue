                    In general, the Group functionality in Fiber behaves
                    similarly to ExpressJS. Groups are declared virtually and
                    all routes declared within the group are flattened into a
                    single list with a prefix, which is then checked by the
                    framework in the order it was declared. This means that the
                    behavior of Group in Fiber is identical to that of
                    ExpressJS.
