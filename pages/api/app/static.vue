                You can use any virtual path prefix (where the path does not
                actually exist in the file system) for files that are served by
                the Static method, specify a prefix path for the static
                directory, as shown below:

            <P>
                If you want to have a little bit more control regarding the
                settings for serving static files. You could use the
                <Tag>fiber.Static</Tag> struct to enable specific settings.
